# InfiniteObsidian Plugin!

This plugin allows you to place obsidian without the stack running out, costing money every time its placed.

This is a PLUGIN, and it goes into your `/plugins/` folder on your server. It will not work if It's elsewhere!

### How it works:

You can obtain InfiniteObsidian by it given to you with /infiniteObsidian give, and then this will allow you to place it
anywhere, and the stack never runs out, it will keep replenishing. It will take a configurable amount of money out every
time you place it.
